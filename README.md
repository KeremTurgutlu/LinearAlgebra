### **COOL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS WITH LINEAR ALGEBRA** 

This repository consists of Linear Algebra applications with their documentation of understanding the key concepts and derivation of the concepts, as well as implementation in Python.

**1) GaussELimination:** Solving Ax = b by gauss elimination.

**2) LeastSquares:** Finds the solution for projection of b, p when there is no solution for Ax = b. Formula: $A^TA\hat{x} = A^Tb$

**3) SVD:** Understanding singular value decomposition, why we can apply it to any given matrix.
