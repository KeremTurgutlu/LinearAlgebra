### **COOL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS WITH LINEAR ALGEBRA** 

This repository consists of Linear Algebra applications with their documentation of understanding the key concepts and derivation of the concepts, as well as implementation in Python.

**1) GaussElimination:** Solving Ax = b by gauss elimination.
**2) LeastSquares:** Finds the solution for projection of b on A, p when there is no solution for Ax = b.
**3) SVD:** Understanding singular value decomposition, why we can apply it to any given matrix.
**4) PageRank:** Exploring how PageRank algorithm gives one unique solution with posiive column stochastic matrices.
